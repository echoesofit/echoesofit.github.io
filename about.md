about echo

i'm a disabled artist and author, dealing with debilitative mental health issues. currently i'm creating hand-crafted digital art and writings as i'm able to. 

in the past i've created everything from websites and short films to music and video games, but more than anything i enjoy dabbling in all kinds of creative media.
